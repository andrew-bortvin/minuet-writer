# minuet-writer

This is a work in progress program that writes stylistically appropriate two-voice Baroque minuets using a random choice guided by rules. 

The minuet writer autonomously generates a sequence of notes, and then converts them to LilyPond notation for engraving. The LilyPond notation is used to generate an engraved score and midi audio of the minuet. 

Example score:
